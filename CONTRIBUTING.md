# How to contribute to RimWorld Together
So you have decided to contribute into the project? That's great news! We always like to welcome new members into our team.

We need to make sure everyone follows a certain set of contribution steps, so everything keeps tidy and running.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please **DO NOT** open issues that cover sensitive topics of the project (IE: Security Vulnerabilities) directly, reach out to any person in charge to inform them directly so the issue can be fixed as soon as possible.

## Before developing the implementation:
### Check that it isn't already being worked on.
- Always check current project [branches](https://github.com/RimworldTogether/Rimworld-Together/branches) and standing [pull requests](https://github.com/RimworldTogether/Rimworld-Together/pulls) to avoid duplicates.
### Check that it isn't too big.
- Requests that are big in code changes might take too much time or be automatically discarded for being too difficult to test completely due to the nature of the project. Try dividing the implementation into different pieces when possible.
### Check that it won't completely remove another feature.
- While the nature of open sourced projects usually makes code change constantly, please make sure not to completely remove already existing features. If it's needed for any specific reason, please contact a person in charge before going forward with it.

> [!NOTE]
> TLDR: Make sure it's not being already worked on, make small changes, and don't remove already existing features!

## While developing the implementation:
### Refrain from using code practices that might be difficult to read by other fellow developers.
- Compact and extremely efficient code is great for performance, although it's also good for scaring away newcomers and other coders. Please make sure to use coding techniques that are easy to read and understand by the average person.
### Make use of comments whenever you see minimally fit.
- If you find yourself not completely understanding what your code does, the rest of the coders will have a hard time understanding it. A comment or two can go a long way into making everything more accessible.
### Use coding / typing techniques that match our project's current structure.
- More information can be found at our [Syntax Ruleset](https://github.com/RimworldTogether/Rimworld-Together/blob/development/SYNTAX.md).

> [!NOTE]
> TLDR: Keep your code simple, easy to read, and consistent with the current one!

## Before asking for a pull request:
### Make sure you were running on the latest changes available.
- Always double check you were coding on our [latest changes branch](https://github.com/RimworldTogether/Rimworld-Together/tree/development). Failing to do so might lead to the PR being unable to get accepted.
### Make sure you have added everything you wanted before submitting.
- Once submitted for a request, updating the branch several times can lead to an increase in the time it takes to have it reviewed and pushed. It's advised your branch doesn't need any other changes when it's set as requested.
### Make sure you have tested thoroughly before submitting a PR.
- This is specially true for the scope of our project. RimWorld is a finicky game when it comes to multiplayer, and many things tend to break with changes that aren't directly tied to it.

> [!NOTE]
> TLDR: Make sure everything is ready and you didn't miss anything!

## While asking for a pull request:
### Add as much information as possible on the pull request.
- Use informative titles, descriptions, and tags. The more information you add, the easier it will be for the person in charge to review your changes as soon as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> TLDR: Give as many details as possible about your new craft!

## Any doubts after reading?
### Make sure to ask around with an [issue](https://github.com/RimworldTogether/Rimworld-Together/issues), or ask around at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yUF2ec8Vt8) server for more information.
- We understand that the process of contributing might be tedious and difficult, and will lend you a hand whenever it's possible.

Thank you in advance! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

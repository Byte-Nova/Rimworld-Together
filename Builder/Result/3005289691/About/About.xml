	<description>Ever wondered how would it be to be able to play with other players online in the same Rimworld world?\n
"Rimworld Together" is an early access community project founded by people who want to push the idea further!\n
Join a playstyle in which other players will actually be able to affect you!\n
Chat with them, trade with them, spy on them, raid them, build sites with them or even visit them in real time!\n
The list only gets bigger, what are you waiting for? Play, Together!
